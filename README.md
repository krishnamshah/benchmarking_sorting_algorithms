# benchmarking_sorting_algorithms
Benchmarking of Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Tim Sort, Quick Sort, Numpy sort, and Python sort.


Among Insertionsort, Bubblesort, Mergesort, Quicksort,
Timsort, Built-in Python sort, and NumPy sort that we
tested, Built-in Python was the fastest in sorting sorted and
reversed data whereas NumPy sort execution was better for
large randomized data. Though Bubblesort performed well
with sorted data, it lagged in sorting random data by almost
25000 times for ten thousand input data as per the result
from the benchmark. The built-in sorting function in Python
and NumPy sort appears to triumph over the alternative
sorting technique if we focus on the time performance only
